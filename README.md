# .dotfiles
This repository is where I store my configuration of the tools that I use. You will find mainly configs for CLI software, since I am a terminal junkie.

## A lot of the files are very cluttered! I will most likely (probably (maybe) (perhaps) (perchance)) clean them up at some point!
Don't expect to see any changes in my Vim configuration, because I have switched to NeoVim (that's where the money at). There is no way to install this all into a working state. I used to use GNU stow, but it didn't like that I had links in my home directory, so idk lol. Also don't bother with the install script, I haven't touched it since unix was invented (that's called a hyperbole btw).

## Font

My preferred font is FiraCode, since it adds some nice glyphs. However, due to me also using code icons I use a patched version of FiraCode which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest/) along with many others if FiraCode doesn't suit your style.
